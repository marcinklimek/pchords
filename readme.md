# PChords

## Motivation

I need to improve playing chords on the piano. So I decided to write a simple tool to help me with this.

## The world in brief
The initial version is just a console app. Then, hopefully, I will have a reason to write a simple GUI.

What I have now:
* generation of major and minor chords (dominants, half-diminished and altered soon)
* the randomly chosen chord has to be played starting from the third or the seventh (major/minor) without unison
* played notes (read through midi) are compared with the generated ones
